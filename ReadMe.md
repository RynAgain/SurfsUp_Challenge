## Summary

Data shows that the weather is lovely year round.  Few days are too cold for ice cream or surfing.  More data one the relationship of ice cream and outside temperature needed, but it looks like it should be a reasonable business.

Additional things to consider from our existing data include, the number of rainy days and the amount of rain.  Rain would have a major impact on people's desire for both ice cream and surfing.
